Introduction
============

This is a simple test file that includes all the features of sphinx and its
extensions that we plan to use for the third edition of the
`Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Pratice <https://www.computer-networking.info>`_ ebook. It is designed to test the ability to automatically
build the ebook by using `travis <https://travis-ci.org>`_ and translate it by using `transifex <https://www.transifex.com/>`_.

Each of the files contains a different feature of `sphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org>`_.

This document is divided in sections. We apply the `Pythonâ€™s Style Guide for documenting <https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html#style-guide>`_, i.e. :

  - # with overline, for parts
  - * with overline, for chapters
  - =, for sections
  - , for subsections
  - ^, for subsubsections
  - ", for paragraphs
