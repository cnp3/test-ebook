Introduction
============

   This is a simple test file that includes all the features of sphinx and its
   extensions that we plan to use for the third edition of the
   `Computer Networking: Principles, Protocols and Pratice <https://www.computer-networking.info>`_ ebook. It is designed to test the ability to automatically
   build the ebook by using travail and translate it by using transiflex.

   Each of the files contains a different feature of sphinx.
